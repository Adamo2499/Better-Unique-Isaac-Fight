## Better Unique Isaac fight for The Binding of Isaac: Repentance
### Description
That mod is a reworked version of Unique Isaac Boss Fight created by Laraz created for Improved & Reworked Foes

Unique to this mod:
- Lazarus and Judas won't fight their postmortem versions (Lazarus II and Dark Judas) but instead they'll fight against purified version of themselves*
- Azazel's spirite has been replaced by Repented Azazel from Salvation*

Carried over from predecessor:
- Resprited Angelic Baby while playing as Cain, Lilith or Jacob*
- "Leaving body" mechanic for Lost and Soul

* These changes are now configurable via Mod Config Menu

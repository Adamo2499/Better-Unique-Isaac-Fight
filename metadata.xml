    <description>That mod is a reworked version of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563988750]Unique Isaac Boss Fight[/url] created by Laraz created for [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2847697646]Improved &amp; Reworked Foes[/url]

Unique to this mod:
- Lazarus and Judas won't fight their postmortem versions (Lazarus II and Dark Judas) but instead they'll fight against purified version of themselves*
- Azazel's spirite has been replaced by Repented Azazel from [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329555283]Salvation[/url]*

Carried over from predecessor:
- Resprited Angelic Baby while playing as Cain, Lilith or Jacob*
- &quot;Leaving body&quot; mechanic for Lost and Soul

* These changes are now configurable via Mod Config Menu

Known issues:
- Whike having installed either [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3343815332]LastJudgement[/url] or [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416652487]Last Judgement Resprites for Reworked Foes[/url] alongside this mod, Isaac's sprited will be corrupted bc LJ takes priority over this mod. I'm working on way to make it compatible

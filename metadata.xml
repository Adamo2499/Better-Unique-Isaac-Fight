    <description>That mod is a reworked version of Unique Isaac Boss Fight created by Laraz (available here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2563988750)

Reworked Enemies and Bosses is highly recommended

Main changes between this mod and Laraz' version:
- All sprites are remade in mind of Reworked Foes mod
- Lazarus and Judas won't fight their postmortem versions (Lazarus II and Dark Judas) but instead they'll fight against purified version of themselfs
- Azazel's spirite has been replaced by Repented Azazel from Salvation mod</description>
    <version>1.2</version>
